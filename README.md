Embedded Video Events Tracking System for Youtube videos


This library is intended to make possible to track user actions from embedded Youtube videos on Google Analytics

The only thing I ask for is credit: don't delete the about please :)

This library needs jQuery, not tested the minimum version needed but 1.4 works nice. 
Evets only uses jQuery to make an AJAX request to Youtube API to get the video title and to make a foreach loop.
Next versions could avoid these calls and get rid of jQuery.

This is my first public work so my apologies if some of the code is ugly or bad commented.
I would try to fix a couple of things I don't like in next versions.

Enjoy!
