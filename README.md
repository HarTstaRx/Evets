Embedded Video Events Tracking System for Youtube videos


This library is intended to make possible to track user actions from embedded Youtube videos on Google Analytics

This library needs jQuery, not tested the minimum version needed but 1.4 works nice. 
Evets only uses jQuery to make an AJAX request to Youtube API to get the video title and to make a foreach loop.
Next versions could avoid these calls and get rid of jQuery.

Enjoy!
